JOURNAL ARTICLE

1. Create a new R project
2. In the terminal window,

quarto use template quarto-journals/jss

which will ask some questions, so answer like this:

? Do you trust the authors of this template (Y/n) › Yes
? Create a subdirectory for template? (Y/n) › Yes
? Directory name: › paper

? Would you like to continue (Y/n) › Yes

3. This creates the "paper" folder.
Let's take a look at what it holds.

4. You'll want to open the paper.qmd file, into the RStudio text editor.

5. Typeset the paper by clicking "Render".
Notice that the paper.pdf file is written, which we can open.
(Also notice that it saves the paper.tex file which is the intermediate
file that generates the final pdf - don't edit this file.)

6. Now we can start to make modifications. These include:

- adding figures and making the hyperlink
- adding references and making hyperlinks
