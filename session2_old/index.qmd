## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how to use the Quarto journal and thesis templates.
- Manage references and citations.
- Add and customize code chunks, equations, figures, and tables in Quarto.

## 📝 Quarto Template for Journal Paper

With **Quarto**, you can create fully formatted and reproducible journal articles with ease.

You have two options:

* ✨ **Start fresh** using a journal-specific template.
* 🔧 **Apply the format** to an existing Quarto project.


In this workshop, we will use the official template for the ***Journal of Statistical Software (JSS)***.

This template includes:

* A pre-configured YAML header
* Sample `.qmd` content
* A bibliography file (`references.bib`)

You’ll be able to write, cite, and format your article — ready for submission — all in Quarto!

## 🚀 Let's Begin...

### 🆕 Creating a New Article

To start a new article using the **Journal of Statistical Software (JSS)** template, run this command in your terminal or RStudio console:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-journals/jss
```

This will:

* Install the JSS extension
* Create a new folder with:

  * A sample `.qmd` file
  * A sample bibliography (`references.bib`)

You'll be ready to write your article right away!

---

### 🛠️ Applying the Format to an Existing Project

Already have a Quarto document or project?
Install the JSS format with:

```bash
quarto add quarto-journals/jss
```

Then, update your YAML header to use the new format.

✅ Now you’re ready to write and render in the JSS style!

## 🧪 [Let's Try It Together!]{style="color:#006DAE;"}

Now it's your turn to try creating a Quarto journal article using the **JSS template**.

### 🧭 Steps to Follow

1. **Open RStudio or your terminal**
2. Run this command to create a new project:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-journals/jss
```

3. Open the new folder and locate:

   * `index.qmd` (main article)
   * `references.bib` (sample bibliography)

4. Click **Render** to preview the document as PDF or HTML

## 🎓 Monash Quarto Thesis Template

The **Monash Quarto Thesis Template** helps you create a well-structured, submission-ready thesis following Monash University guidelines.

### 🆕 Create a New Thesis Project

To get started, run the following command in your terminal or RStudio console:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-monash/thesis
```

This will:

* Install the Monash thesis extension
* Create a new project folder with:

  * A pre-configured `index.qmd`
  * Chapter files (`chapters/`)
  * Front matter and bibliography
  * A ready-to-render thesis structure

<!-- 📘 You'll be ready to start writing your thesis with Monash-compliant formatting right out of the box! -->

## 📚 Adding a Bibliography to `.qmd` Files

````markdown
### 1. Create a `.bib` File (BibTeX Format)

```bibtex
@article{smith2021,
  title = {A Method for Data Analysis},
  author = {Smith, Jane},
  journal = {Journal of Statistics},
  year = {2021}
}
````

💡 Save as: `references.bib`


### 2. Link the `.bib` File in YAML

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl  # Optional: adds citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE)
```

### 3. Cite in the Text

```markdown
As shown in recent work [@smith2021], the method is effective.
```

🔄 Quarto will automatically format the in-text citation and generate a reference list.

<!-- ### 🔍 Tips -->

<!-- * Download CSL files from [zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles) -->
<!-- * You can also use reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley) to export `.bib` files. -->
<!-- * Supports multiple `.bib` files if needed. -->

<!-- ## More exercises on adding code chunks, equations, figures, and tables -->

<!-- PDF and HTML versions, equations and figures cross-reference, code chunks (show and hide) -->

# ⚙️ Quarto Quirks & Power Tips

---

### 📐 LaTeX Equation in a Figure Caption

```markdown
![This figure demonstrates the equation $E = mc^2$.](figure.png){#fig-einstein}
```

✅ You can embed LaTeX-style equations directly using dollar signs (`$...$`) in the caption.

✅ Works in both **HTML** and **PDF** outputs.

---

### Refer to Another Figure in a Caption

```markdown
![Here we compare this with Figure @fig-einstein.](comparison.png){#fig-compare}
```

📝 `@fig-einstein` will resolve to the numbered figure reference (e.g., *Figure 1*) in PDF/HTML.

📌 Make sure the first figure has an ID like `{#fig-einstein}`.

---

### 🔗 Hyperlink in a Table

```markdown
| Tool   | Link                              |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Quarto | [quarto.org](https://quarto.org) |
```

✅ Use standard Markdown syntax inside tables: `[text](url)`

✅ Works for **external links**, local files, and section anchors.

---

### 🖼 Alt-Text in Figure Chunk

```markdown
![Scatterplot of speed vs. distance](cars-plot.png){fig-alt="A scatterplot showing car stopping distances by speed."}
```

✅ Use `fig-alt="..."` to improve **accessibility** and support screen readers.

👍 Highly recommended for academic publishing and accessibility standards.


## 🎯 What We Learned

* 📝 **Journal Articles** – You can create a JSS-formatted article using `quarto use template quarto-journals/jss`.
* 🎓 **Monash Thesis** – The Monash thesis template gives you a structured, submission-ready format out of the box.
* 📚 **Citations** – Bibliographies are managed with `.bib` files and citations inserted using `[@key]` syntax.
* 📊 **Code & Output** – Quarto lets you embed R code, equations, figures, and tables with full formatting control.
