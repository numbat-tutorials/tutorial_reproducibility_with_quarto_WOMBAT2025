## üíª üìÉ What is reproducible research?

<br><br>

**The National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine in the USA says:**

> *Reproducibility means obtaining consistent results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code and conditions of analysis*.

<br><br><br><br>

::: {.f50}

[Reference: Report on reproducibility and replicability](https://www.nap.edu/read/25303/chapter/1#xix)

:::

## Why?

:::{.incremental}

- **Efficiency**: allow changes to be implemented more easily, especially for dynamic reproducible documents.

- **Repeatability**: the analysis can be repeated multiple times while still obtaining the same results.

- **Transparency**: everything is available for access, resulting in more trustworthy results.

- **Easy to update**: when new data arrives, the report can be automatically updated.

:::

:::{.fragment}

*And future you will thank you, because they will know what past you was thinking*. It helps memory, collaboration, and sharing.

:::

## How might the project look?

:::

## How to combine text and data analysis?

<br>

::: {.callout-note}
## Literate programming

Literate programming is an approach to writing reports using software that weaves together the source code and text at the time of creation.
:::

::: {.smaller}

Reproducibility requires more than literate programming. These are:

- a versioning and sharing system, like GitHub and git. 
- software environment supporting workflows such as [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) or [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html).

*But these will not be in this workshop.* 

:::


## Dynamics documents 

- A dynamic document includes **code** used for data analysis and **text** explaining the analysis and results.

- These two things produce a **report**, a **paper**, or **presentation** sequentially and dynamically, and possibly different output formats, html, pdf, docx, ppt, by changing one line in the file. 

:::{.fragment}

More on papers and presentations in the next sessions! *Here we focus on reports!*

:::


## Main tools for reproducible research

- **R**: the programming language.

- **RStudio**: an integrated developer environment (IDE).

- **Quarto**: tools for writing a complete analysis, and combines text and code together.

::: {.smaller}
Similar tools are available in other languages, and Quarto can contain code chunks of various languages, possibly in the same document.
:::

# Getting started 

## [First step]{style="color:#006DAE;"}

:::{.callout-caution}

## Practicing

1. Create a project.

2. Create a quarto document.

3. Render document.

Your turn!

:::


## Elements of a reproducible project

- All the elements of the project should be files.
- All files should be stored within the project location (typically a folder).
- All files should be explicitly tied together.

:::{.fragment}

But how do we tie the files together?

:::


## Computer paths

A path is the complete location or name of where a computer file, directory, or web page is located.

Examples:

- `Windows: C:\\Documents\\workshop`
- `Mac/Linux: /Users/Documents/workshop`
- `Internet: https://numbat.space/`


## Absolute and Relative paths

- **Absolute**: start from the lowest level, typically a drive letter or root (/)
  - `/Users/Documents/workshop` ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Relative**: refers to a location that is relative to the current directory. 
  - `./workshop`

::: {.callout-important}
Absolute paths should be avoided since it is extremely unlikely another person will have the same absolute path as you.
:::


## Work projects

- **Data folder**: contains all the data for the project.
- **Images/Figures folder**: contains all the external pictures not produced by the code in the qmd file.
- `.Rproj` file: automatically added when creating an RStudio project (handles the relative paths and working directories).
- `qmd` file: quarto document
- Other `R` scripts, etc...

# Quarto details

## Quarto

- Provides a framework for integrating code and text into a single document.

- The code is written within the code chunks, put the text around that, and get a fully reproducible document.

## Quarto document elements

1. **Text** (formatted with Markdown)

2. **Code** (code formatting)

3. **Metadata** (YAML)

::: {.f50}
[Source: Quarto Cheatsheets](https://rstudio.github.io/cheatsheets/quarto.pdf)
:::


## Dynamic documents

Quarto + `knitr` = Dynamic document

- Quarto allows the use of Markdown for writing **text** in the report and also to include **R code**.
- `knitr` runs all code chunks, and "knit" the results into a markdown file (replacing R chunks with output).
- `pandoc` is used to convert the markdown file to different output formats.


## Quarto: text (Markdown)

Markdown is a lightweight markup language for adding formatting elements to plain text documents.

- Text formatting
- Headings 
- Links & Images
- Lists
- Many more...


## Text formatting & Headings

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
Markdown Syntax:

```markdown
*italics*, _italics_

**bold**, __bold__

***bold italics***, ___bold italics___

~~strikethrough~~

`verbatimcode`

# Heading 1

## Heading 2
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Results:

::: {.smaller}
*italics*, _italics_

::::

## [Your turn!]{style="color:#006DAE;"}

::: {.callout-caution}
## Practicing

1. Create different heading levels.
2. Write 1-2 sentences with different text formatting.
3. Add images.
:::


## Quarto: code (R)

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

R code:

````
```{{r}}
#| echo: false

1+1
``` 
````

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Results:

```{r}
#| echo: false

1 + 1
```

:::

::::

Insert an R code chunk into a Quarto document with:

- Keyboard short cut Ctrl + Alt + I (Mac: Cmd + Option + I)

- Typing the chunk delimiters (```)

Chunk output can be customised with **Chunk execution options**, which are at the top of a chunk, starting with `#|`


## Chunk execution options

- `eval: false` does not evaluate (run) this code chunk when knitting.
- `echo: false` does not show the source code in the finished file.
- `include: false` prevents code and results from showing in the finished file.
- `message: false` prevents messages that are generated by code from showing in the finished file.
- `warning: false` prevents warnings that are generated from showing in the finished file
- `fig.cap = "Text"` adds a caption to a figure

There are many more; see Quarto documentation.


## Tables and captions

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

R code:

````
```{{r}}
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)

data(cars)

table_data <- head(cars, 5)

knitr::kable(table_data,
             caption = "Speed and stopping 
             distances of cars")
``` 
````

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Results:

::: {width="50%"}

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(ggplot2)

data(cars)

table_data <- head(cars, 5)

knitr::kable(table_data,
             caption = "Speed and stopping 
             distances of cars") |> 
  kableExtra::kable_paper(
    full_width = TRUE
    )
```

:::

:::

::::


## Figures and captions

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

R code:

````
```{{r}}
#| fig-label: cars-plot
#| fig-cap: "Distance taken for a car to stop, against it's speed during the test."

ggplot(cars,
      aes(x = speed,
          y = dist)
      ) +
  geom_point()
``` 
````

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

Results:

::: {width="50%"}

```{r}
#| fig-label: cars-plot
#| fig-cap: "Distance taken for a car to stop, against it's speed during the test."
#| fig-height: 3

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(cars,
      aes(x = speed,

format:
  html:
    toc: true
    theme: solar
  pdf:
    toc: true
```


## HTML result

## PDF result

![](images/pdf-example.png){fig-align="center"}


## [Your turn!]{style="color:#006DAE;"}

:::{.callout-caution}
## Practice

1. Change the title
2. Add your name as an author
3. Use HTML and PDF format
:::


# Quarto templates

## What is a quarto template?

The templates provide a straightforward way to get started with new Quarto projects by providing example content and options.

:::{.incremental}

1. Create a working initial document for custom formats

2. Provide the initial content for a custom project type

:::

:::{.fragment}

Remember all the painstaking work we did earlier, setting YAML, creating all the folders, and setting the execution options.

:::

:::{.fragment}

All of that can be gone with one line in the terminal!!

:::


## Using a template

The command below copies the contents from the GitHub repository to our local system.

`quarto use template numbat-tutorials/workshop-template`


## üìù Quarto Template for Journal Paper

With **Quarto**, you can create fully formatted and reproducible journal articles with ease.

You have two options:

* ‚ú® **Start fresh** using a journal-specific template.
* üîß **Apply the format** to an existing Quarto project.


In this workshop, we will use the official template for the ***Journal of Statistical Software (JSS)***.

This template includes:

* A pre-configured YAML header
* Sample `.qmd` content
* A bibliography file (`references.bib`)

You‚Äôll be able to write, cite, and format your article ‚Äî ready for submission ‚Äî all in Quarto!

## üöÄ Let's Begin...

### üÜï Creating a New Article

To start a new article using the **Journal of Statistical Software (JSS)** template, run this command in your terminal or RStudio console:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-journals/jss
```

This will:

* Install the JSS extension
* Create a new folder with:

  * A sample `.qmd` file
  * A sample bibliography (`references.bib`)

You'll be ready to write your article right away!

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Applying the Format to an Existing Project

Already have a Quarto document or project?
Install the JSS format with:

```bash
quarto add quarto-journals/jss
```

Then, update your YAML header to use the new format.

‚úÖ Now you‚Äôre ready to write and render in the JSS style!


<!-- ### Resource to find journal templates -->

<!-- https://github.com/quarto-journals -->


## üß™ [Let's Try It Together!]{style="color:#006DAE;"}

Now it's your turn to try creating a Quarto journal article using the **JSS template**.

### üß≠ Steps to Follow

1. **Open RStudio or your terminal**
2. Run this command to create a new project:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-journals/jss
```

3. Open the new folder and locate:

   * `index.qmd` (main article)
   * `references.bib` (sample bibliography)

4. Click **Render** to preview the document as PDF or HTML

üôã Raise your hand or drop a question if you need help!

## üéì Monash Quarto Thesis Template

The **Monash Quarto Thesis Template** helps you create a well-structured, submission-ready thesis following Monash University guidelines.

### üÜï Create a New Thesis Project

To get started, run the following command in your terminal or RStudio console:

```bash
quarto use template quarto-monash/thesis
```

This will:

* Install the Monash thesis extension
* Create a new project folder with:

  * A pre-configured `index.qmd`
  * Chapter files (`chapters/`)
  * Front matter and bibliography
  * A ready-to-render thesis structure

<!-- üìò You'll be ready to start writing your thesis with Monash-compliant formatting right out of the box! -->

# Let's take a 30-minute break

## üìö Adding a Bibliography to `.qmd` Files

````markdown
### 1. Create a `.bib` File (BibTeX Format)

```bibtex
@article{smith2021,
  title = {A Method for Data Analysis},
  author = {Smith, Jane},
  journal = {Journal of Statistics},
  year = {2021}
}
````

üí° Save as: `references.bib`


### 1. Link the `.bib` File in YAML

```yaml
bibliography: references.bib
csl: apa.csl  # Optional: adds citation style (e.g., APA, IEEE)
```

### 2. Cite in the Text

```markdown
As shown in recent work [@smith2021], the method is effective.
```

üîÑ Quarto will automatically format the in-text citation and generate a reference list.

<!-- ### üîç Tips -->

<!-- * Download CSL files from [zotero.org/styles](https://www.zotero.org/styles) -->
<!-- * You can also use reference managers (Zotero, Mendeley) to export `.bib` files. -->
<!-- * Supports multiple `.bib` files if needed. -->

<!-- ## More exercises on adding code chunks, equations, figures, and tables -->

<!-- PDF and HTML versions, equations and figures cross-reference, code chunks (show and hide) -->

# ‚öôÔ∏è Quarto Quirks & Power Tips

---

### üìê LaTeX Equation in a Figure Caption

```markdown
![This figure demonstrates the equation $E = mc^2$.](figure.png){#fig-einstein}
```

‚úÖ You can embed LaTeX-style equations directly using dollar signs (`$...$`) in the caption.

‚úÖ Works in both **HTML** and **PDF** outputs.

---

### Refer to Another Figure in a Caption

```markdown
![Here we compare this with Figure @fig-einstein.](comparison.png){#fig-compare}
```

üìù `@fig-einstein` will resolve to the numbered figure reference (e.g., *Figure 1*) in PDF/HTML.

üìå Make sure the first figure has an ID like `{#fig-einstein}`.

---

### üîó Hyperlink in a Table

```markdown
| Tool   | Link                              |
|--------|-----------------------------------|
| Quarto | [quarto.org](https://quarto.org) |
```

‚úÖ Use standard Markdown syntax inside tables: `[text](url)`

‚úÖ Works for **external links**, local files, and section anchors.

---

### üñº Alt-Text in Figure Chunk

```markdown
![Scatterplot of speed vs. distance](cars-plot.png){fig-alt="A scatterplot showing car stopping distances by speed."}
```

‚úÖ Use `fig-alt="..."` to improve **accessibility** and support screen readers.

üëç Highly recommended for academic publishing and accessibility standards.


## üéØ What We Learned

* üìù **Journal Articles** ‚Äì You can create a JSS-formatted article using `quarto use template quarto-journals/jss`.
* üéì **Monash Thesis** ‚Äì The Monash thesis template gives you a structured, submission-ready format out of the box.
* üìö **Citations** ‚Äì Bibliographies are managed with `.bib` files and citations inserted using `[@key]` syntax.
* üìä **Code & Output** ‚Äì Quarto lets you embed R code, equations, figures, and tables with full formatting control.

# Keep writing and keep it reproducible üí°
